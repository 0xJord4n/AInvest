The project aim to provide an ai agent to help people invest into crypto using DCA with TWAP strategy and crosschain access (we will talk about crosschain later)

We want to use phalat to host in a tee network and give theuser the possibility to verify the environment of the agent,
and make him invest automiatically the money on the wallet on a regular (pre choose) basis.

Our goal here is to run the agent and create the endpoint to interact with him (the agent can do transactions, notify the suer that we are on  local  top and prompt him to sell a bit, send some notification about the weekly performance of the agent 

The stack is viem for interacting with blockchain, push protocol to send notifications, claude through redpill for the agent, and phala for the execution layer.

Help me build this step by step (we don t careabout the frontend we will just create some endpoint to make it easy for the frontend to interact probably)
e read the docs and make sure to  use delegatewallet from privy and use my acutal template proceed step by steps to create evrything
